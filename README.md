## Introduction

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Google Play Store dataset. The Google Play Store is a rich source of data, and this EDA project aims to gain insights into the app ecosystem available on the platform.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: [Google Play Store Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps). It includes information about various apps available on the Google Play Store, such as app names, categories, user reviews, ratings, and more.

## Goals

The primary objectives of this EDA project are as follows:
1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleanse the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical analyses to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to present key insights in a visually appealing manner.
5. **User Engagement Analysis**: Investigate user reviews, ratings, and download trends.
6. **Category Insights**: Explore the distribution of apps across different categories.
